## Precedure
 - Number of plates: 30 plates
 - plate maximum: 15 mL
 - prapare ~500 mL LB agar
note: always make a bit more gel-agar mix than you think you’ll need. 
The extra empty volume is necessary to prevent your molten agar from boiling over in the autoclave.

### Prepare LB Agar
1. Add 250 mL of dH2O to a graduated cyclindar.
2. Weigh out 20g of premix LB Agar powder (VWR DF0445-17) or:
||weight|
|-----------|-------|
|tryptone	| 4.0 g |
|yeast extract	| 2.0 g |
|NaCl	| 4.0 g |
|Agar 	| 6.0 g |
3. Mix powder well to bring into solution, Add dH2O to total volume of 400 mL and transfer to 1 L flask
4. Put on stirring hot plate and heat to boil for 1 min while stirring.
Transfer to 1 L pyrex jar and label with autoclave tape.

### Prepare your plate pouring station:
Materials
Count out the appropriate number of plates and stack them on your lab bench.
Label the plates with the date and the medium they will contain including the identity of the antibiotic.
*Pro-Tip* Batch label plates with colored marker - particular colors correspond to particular antibiotics.
Prepare antibiotics.
Prior to adding your antibiotic to the molten gel mix, create a 1000x stock solution.
For example: If you’ll be preparing plates with a final concentration of 100 ug/mL ampicillin, you should make a stock solution of 100,000 ug/mL (100 mg/mL). Simply measure out 100 mg of ampicillin powder, add it to 1 mL of water, dissolve by vortexing, and filter sterilize.

Prepare a water bath at 60 ℃ with sufficient water to submerge ~75% of the bottle containing your molten gel mixture.
*Pro-Tip* You will cool the molten agar in the water bath prior to adding the antibiotic. 60 ℃ is a good temperature because the molten agar will remain liquid at this temperature but most antibiotics will not break down at this temperature. Check with your antibiotic’s manufacturer to make sure this is true in your case.
Retrieve your molten agar mix from the autoclave.
*Pro-Tip* Once your autoclave cycle is complete, we recommend opening the door to the autoclave just a crack and leaving it open that way for ~10 min. This will allow any steam to escape from the autoclave and will cool your gel-mix slightly. Even so, you should always use thermally insulated gloves when removing anything from the autoclave.
Partially submerge your molten gel-mix in the 60 ℃ water bath.
*Pro-Tip* You should leave the molten gel-mix in the water bath for at least 5 min. Do not let any of the water bath water touch the neck or top of the bottle as this water is not likely to be sterile. Cooled agar should be warm to the touch; as a rule of thumb, if you cannot take the molten agar out of the water bath wearing only lab gloves, it’s not likely cool enough to add antibiotic to. To be certain your agar is at the right temperature, we recommend using a laser thermometer.


###   Pouring the Plates
Light the flame at the plate pouring station and dilute your antibiotic into your ~60 ℃ molten gel mix using sterile technique.
Swirl the agar bottle to ensure even distribution of the antibiotic throughout the agar.
Open one plate at a time next to the flame and begin pouring. Measure your desired amount of agar with a pipete for the first plate to get a good idea of what that volume looks like in your particular plate.
For the remainder of the plates, pour directly from the bottle.
*Pro-Tip* Be sure to swirl your plates after pouring to remove bubbles and ensure an even distrubtion of agar over the bottom of the plate. Cap each plate after pouring and stack as you pour.
*Pro-Tip* If your agar partially solidifies in the bottle while you’re pouring, you should stop pouring and re-make the gel-mix. If you’re making plates without any antibiotic you can alternatively re-liquefy the agar by running it through the autoclave again or by microwaving (if you microwave, beware of over-boiling!).
Leave your plates out on the bench to solidify, overnight drying, place plates in plastic bags. store at 4 ℃ 
*Pro-Tip* It takes roughly 30 min for our plates to solidify at room temperature, however we leave them out at room temperature overnight to allow them to dry.  After overnight drying,  place the plates in a plastic bag with an absorbent material to reduce condensation. 


The plates are then stored at 4 ℃ until use.

Once your plates have solidified and dried, you should test them to make sure the antibiotic functions properly:
    * Take out two plates.
    * On the first plate, streak out a strain that you know to be resistant to the antibiotic.
    * On the second plate, streak out a strain that’s not resistant to the antibiotic.
    * Incubate both plates overnight at the appropriate growth temperature and check for growth.
