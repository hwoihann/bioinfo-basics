## Materials 
--- 
### 1. [Dharmacon™ Edit-R™ CRISPR-Cas9 materials for gene engineering](https://dharmacon.horizondiscovery.com/?rdr=true&LangType=2052&pageid=501)

 - Edit-R Cas9 Nuclease mRNA, 20 μg (1 μg/μL; Cat#CAS11195 ,   #CAS11859 ,    or #CAS11860)
 - Synthetic targeting guide RNA (choose one):
     1.  Edit-R synthetic crRNA and tracrRNA oligos: a. crRNA, predesigned for your gene of interest in a variety of sizes,  or designed and ordered using the Dharmacon CRISPR Design Toolb. tracrRNA, 5, 20 or 50 nmol (Cat #U-002005-XX)          or


### 2. Electroporation experiments
主要是两类，细胞培养试剂和细胞穿孔仪器
 - standard cell culture reagents
 - instruments appropriate for cell maintenance 

电穿孔设备
 - Electroporation reagents (buffer, cuvettes, transfer pipettes)
 - Multi-well tissue culture plates or tissue culture dishes 
 - Antibiotic-free complete medium: Cell culture medium (including serum and/or supplements) without antibiotic, recommended for maintenanceand passaging of the cells of interest • Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)• Assay(s) for detecting gene engineering events in a cell population • 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 nuclease-free buffer (Tris buffer) solution (Dharmacon, Cat #B-006000-100)
