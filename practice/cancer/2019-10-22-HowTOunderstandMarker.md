# Meaning of Tumor Markers

definition:
proteins produced by cancer tissue or by body in response to cancer growth (blood, urine, and tissue)

genetic changes associated with certain cancers, can be used as tumor markers to help determine prognosis, guide targeted treatment, and/or detect cancers early on


evaluation:
 -  sensitive
 -  specific

Limitation: are not diagnostic for cancer, provide additional information that can be considered in conjunction with a patient's medical history and physical exam as well as other laboratory and/or imaging tests

Usage
- Screen. 高危人群筛查
- Help diagnose. 诊断
- Stage. 扩散程度
- Determine prognosis. 预测预后程度
- Guide choice of treatment.  指导治疗选择（组织检测后靶向治疗，因子受体类居多）
- Monitor success of treatment and detect recurrence. （治疗成功率评估和复发指数）

Some most

可能是良性肿瘤最敏感的肿瘤标志物：Chromogranin A 嗜铬粒蛋白 a (CgA)
markers of cell proliferation: Ki-67 and PCNA
Blood test (Serum marker)
 - JAK2 for leukemia
 - T-cell receptor gene rearragenement T
Tissue test (Tissue marker)
 - KRAS for colon

DNA content
 - SSI: stemline scatter index: aneuploid/genomic instability. CIN25, CIN70----- risk of toxic side effects

For breast cancer
Immunity-related gene classifiers: metastasis
 - cell cycle deregulation
 - stromal microenvironment
 - protease蛋白酶
 - endothelial cell
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
Immunity gene signatures

  >Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been well-reported to play critical roles in response to chemotherapy and prognosis in breast cancer, specifically in triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers, with a survival benefit being seen in patients having >50% lymphocyte-predominant tumors.
