如何画一副有生物含义的图？
理解其含义，找到需要的数据，用合适的方法展现，

首先就需要理解其背后的含义



Question: Does MEC17 affect the survival of breast cancer patients?

How did other papers do to analyze those function?
Do I need to repeat those analysis? Easy to difficult?
Repeat others' analysis? Jimmy's blog is OK!

 - What's the markers?
 - Why markers?
 - How to use markers?
 - Synonyms

 (1) predict patient outcome
 (2) predict pathological complete response (pCR) after anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy, and
 (3) capture the main biological diversity displayed by all genes from a microarray.

Early transcriptomic prof ling of breast cancer using microarrays classifed tumors into five intrinsic subtypes:
 - luminal-A
 - luminal-B
 - HER2-enriched
 - basal-like
 - normal breast–like group

GRB7 group score = GRB7 /HER2
ER group score = ER  /PGR /BCL2 /SCUBE2
proliferation: Survivin /KI67  /MYBL2 /CCNB1 [the gene encoding cyclin B1] /STK15
invasion: CTSL2 [the gene encoding cathepsin组织蛋白酶 L2] + MMP11 [the gene encoding stromolysin溶基质蛋白酶 3] ÷ 2
reference gene: ACTB/GADPDH/RPLPO/GUS/TFRC

 Synonyms for subtype
 ---
  - clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer
  - molecular portrait of each tumour
  - comprehensive **profiling** of tumors for cellular composition and molecular feature
  - TNBC molecular taxonomy [n. (生物)分类学,分类系统]
  - subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns


why markers
---
improve risk stratification of patients, guide treatment decisions and surveillance, and help identify new targets for drug development.



How many markers
---
all genes previously implicated in breast cancer (PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, TP53, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MLL3, MAP3K1 and CDKN1B)

novel significantly mutated genes were identified including TBX3,
RUNX1, CBFB: 白血病，造血分化
AFF2
PIK3R1
PTPN22
PTPRD
NF1
SF3B1 splicing factor
 and CCND3


#### 1.2.1 TNBC
定义：Breast tumors that are immunohistochemically characterized by lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 (also def ned by lack of HER2 amplifcation by FISH) are classifed as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and account for approximately 15% to 20% of all breast carcinomas

The oestrogen receptor (ER) positive group is the most numerous and diverse, with several genomic tests to assist in predicting outcomes for ER patients receiving endocrine therapy.
The HER2 (also called ERBB2) amplified group is a great clinical success because of effective therapeutic targeting of HER2, which has led to intense efforts to characterize other DNA copy number aberrations.
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs, lacking expression of ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2), also known as basal-like breast cancers, are a group with only chemotherapy options, and have an increased incidence in patients with germline BRCA1 mutations or of African ancestry

特点
 - higher rates of relapse 高复发
 - greater metastatic potential 高转移
 - shorter overall survival compared with other major breast cancer subtypes 短生存

gene expression patterns characterization
 - 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours
 - 42 different individuals
 - complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes
molecular portrait of each tumour.

Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy,
and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient
Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identi®ed for which variation in messenger RNA levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns
