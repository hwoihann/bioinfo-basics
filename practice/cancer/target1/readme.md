文章思路：CAF细胞群可以提供一个癌症的stromal compartment，这种微环境的异质性会使癌症产生不同的预后效果，作者通过比较
作者收集了新辅助化疗前后的肿瘤样本，将样本划分为对治疗敏感和耐受群体，使用免疫组化检验aSMA和FAP定义CAF细胞，发现完全康复的敏感群体CAF完全消失。并且，u作者通过比较部分康复和进展中的样本生存差异，发现康复群体中的CAF数量远少于耐受样本。
point2： 通过CAF提取物细胞共培养差异结果，确定CAF异质性对化疗耐受有影响——所以要分群
point3：如何分群？找到对治疗敏感和耐受的样本群间差异表达的molecular signature，仅限于“细胞表面”；用PCR和生化手段确认他们存在
传统的fibroblast marker： aSMA/PDGFRb，FAP，FSP1, collagen I
point4：使用两个marker表达量区分样本，做表达量影响的生存分析（MFS/OFS），做subtyping/grading/staging群体里的生存分析
 ER−HER2−, ER+HER2−, and ER+HER2+ subtypes (Figure S1J). On the other hand, in the patients with ER−HER2+
grade-3 breast cancer patients with high CD10+GPR77+ CAF infiltration was significantly shorter, while the one of grade-1/2 patients was independent of CD10+GPR77+ CAF infiltration
associated with shorter patient survival in both stage I/II and III breast cancer (Figure S1J). Consistent with the immunostaining analysis, high expression of both CD10 and GPR77 gene was significantly associated with shorter metastasis-free survival in ER−HER2− (91.28% of which are triple-negative breast cancer) and grade-3 breast cancer patients in online Hatzis dataset (Figure S1K).
also evaluated CD10+GPR77+ CAF number in primary NSCLC samples from 256 patients
-  showed that a specific human CAF subset associated with poor treatment outcome in breast and lung cancers can be marked by high expression of cell-surface CD10 and GPR77.




CAF subset: two cell-surface molecules, CD10 and GPR77
Correlated with chemoresistance and poor survival in multiple cohorts of breast and lung cancer patients.
Promote tumor formation and chemoresistance by providing a survival niche for cancer stem cells (CSCs). 
Driven by persistent NF-κB activation via p65 phosphorylation and acetylation
maintained by complement signaling via GPR77, a C5a receptor.
Promote successful engraftment of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and targeting these CAFs with a neutralizing anti-GPR77 antibody abolishes tumor formation and restores tumor chemosensitivity.  


The scripts were divided into following parts, with different interpretation
Step1.  Paired primary tumor samples obtained from 578 breast cancer patients before and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (partial remission (n = 256) & complete remission (n = 86))
Step2. Evaluate whether the clinical significance of CD10+GPR77+ CAF varies with the characteristics of breast cancer patients, disease-free survival  &  metastasis-free survival  & overall survival
Step3. Evaluate CD10+GPR77+ CAF number in primary NSCLC samples from 256 patients
Step4. Stratify NSCLC patients with higher numbers of CD10+GPR77+ CAFs & survival analysis
Step5. validate three independent online datasets


DFS was defined as the time from surgery prior to recurrent breast cancer, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, occurrence of other second primary cancer, or death from any cause.



RFS was defined as the time from surgery to first local, regional, or distant tumor recurrence-with second primary cancers, contralateral events, and deaths without evidence of disease treated as censoring events.
