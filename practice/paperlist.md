Skills:
1. Graph 分析可以仿照学习画图
2. 巧妙运用了Protein Atalas的图象数据去做机器学习🤔，也值得学习


Resources:
1. public datasets for expression profiling data from pairs of epithelialstromal samples:
  - GSE4823: 22
  - GSE5847: 34+15
  - GSE10797: 28
  - GSE14548: 14
  - GSE35019: 11
数据整合方式：Assembly of an LCM dataset of paired epithelial and stromal samples in normal breast, ERnegative invasive breast cancer, and ER-positive invasive breast cancer




Basic knowledge:
Q1: What consists a stromal compartment?
The stroma contains a variety of different cell types, including smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, perictyes, and adipocytes



Discussion:
Beyond functional validation of network components and application of spatially resolved single cell transcriptome measurements, future work can build on our analysis in several additional directions.
1. The first direction is to generate epithelial-stromal co-expression networks from **larger sample sizes** spanning diverse cancer types. Recently developed molecular methods for spatially resolved transcriptomics and highly multiplexed nextgeneration immunohistochemistry may enable the generation of large, spatially resolved cancer expression profiling datasets. 空间转录组The generation of these datasets across diverse clinically annotated cancer samples will enable the construction of well-powered epithelial-stromal coexpression networks and permit comparative analyses of epithelial-stromal crosstalk networks, network functional enrichment, and network hubs across human cancers.
