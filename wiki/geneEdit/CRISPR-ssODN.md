ssODN

#### Rational design of a ssODN donor template

ssODN template sequences can be designed to bind to either the targeting or non-targeting strands. We recommend designing and testing templates complementary to both strands whenever possible.We have observed robust HDR with homology arms of 30–60 bases, when creating small insertions (e.g., base corrections, tag insertions) using Ultramer Oligonucleotides, for a total maximum donor length of 200 bases. In addition, we find no consistent improvement in HDR efficiency with the use of ssODN templates designed asymmetrically versus symmetrically, regardless of whether the additional length of homology was introduced on the PAM-distal or PAM-proximal side. Taken together, we recommend keeping the desired mutations/insertions approximately centered in the ssODN donor template, flanked by 30–60 nt homology arms on both sides.
