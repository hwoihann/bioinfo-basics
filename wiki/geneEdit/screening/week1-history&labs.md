# 1. Basics of Genetic Screen: History, key of a genetic screen and related labs


## 1. Genetic Screening
### 1.1 mutagenesis screen

A genetic screen is screen is a laboratory procedure used to create and detect a mutant organism.


Mutation introduction: Mutations can be introduced into an organism's genome by exposing the organism to a mutagen, which is an agent that changes the DNA.
+ mutagen
 - environmental agents (ultraviolet light e.g.)
 - chemical agents (ethylmethane sulfonate e.g.)

+ mutagenesis: The process of introducing mutations in DNA is called mutagenesis.


Successful forward genetic screens
1. a defined genetic background of the organism being used
2. a simple yet constant experimental procedure to identify mutants of interest.

### 1.2 enhancer screen
A genetic enhancer screen identifies mutations which enhance a phenotype of interest in an already mutant individual.
Usage:  Isolating enhancer mutants can lead to the identification of interacting genes or genes which act redundantly with respect to one another.

affected process of interest with a known gene mutation.

### 1.3 suppressor screen

Suppressor mutations can be described as second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation.

If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as intragenic suppression, whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as extragenic suppression or intergenic suppression


Usage: Suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways.
