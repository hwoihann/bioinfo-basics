NLS-Cas9-NLS nuclease is the recombinant Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (wt) protein with a nucleic localization signal (NLS) on both N and C terminal, which can be used for genome editing by inducing site-specific DNA double stranded breaks. Cas9 protein forms a very stable ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the guide RNA (gRNA) component of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which can localize to the nucleus immediately once entering the cell with the guide of the NLS. Compared with the mRNA or plasmid systems, transcription and translation processes are not required. This DNA-free system avoids the risk of inserting foreign DNA into the genome, which can be quite useful for gene editing-based disease therapy. Our highly pure and active Cas9 nuclease meets all of the researcher´s requirements (e.g. in vitro cleavage assay, RNP complex transfection, micro injection).

Cas9 Nuclease NLS, S. pyogenes, is an RNA-guided endonuclease that catalyzes site-specific cleavage of double stranded DNA. The location of the break is within the target sequence 3 bases from the NGG PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) (1). The PAM sequence, NGG, must follow the targeted region on the opposite strand of the DNA with respect to the region complementary sgRNA sequence. Cas9 Nuclease NLS, S. pyogenes contains a single Simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on the C terminus of the protein.
